## ✨ Why RK’s Filter Lists?

The modern web is overloaded — ads, trackers, popups, overlays, telemetry, AI scripts, autoplay media, and anti-adblock mechanisms compete aggressively for control.

**RK’s Custom Filter Lists are built to:**

- 🔹 Eliminate noise without breaking sites  
- 🔹 Target same-domain annoyances most lists miss  
- 🔹 Preserve speed, layout, and usability  

> _Not about blocking everything — only what actually matters._

## 🧰 System-Level Filtering

These lists are not browser-only.  
They can be adapted for **DNS-level**, **OS-level**, and **network-level** filtering to block telemetry, background connections, and silent endpoints.

_Your system deserves the same clarity as your browser._
