## ✨ Why RK’s Lists?
The modern web is noisy — ads, trackers, popups, overlays, telemetry, AI scripts, and anti-adblock mechanisms compete for your attention.  

**RK’s Custom Filter Lists exist to:**
- 🔹 Silence the noise  
- 🔹 Preserve site functionality  
- 🔹 Keep performance high  

> _Not about blocking everything — only what matters._

| **Phantom List** | 🔵 Essential | Removes heavy scripts, modules, and clutter — fast, distraction-free browsing. |
| **AdGhost** | 🟣 Elite | Neutralizes anti-adblock overlays, forced dialogs, and intrusive scripts. |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why not rely only on generic large lists?**  
A: Domain-only lists miss same-domain annoyances like popups, redirects, and overlays. Hybrid rules handle them.

**Q: Will sites break?**  
A: Minimal false positives — hybrid rules carefully tested. Aggressive elements removed **before rendering**.

**Q: Mobile compatibility?**  
A: Yes — ZeroDNS is mobile-optimized; hybrid lists work in uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and compatible apps.

**Q: Update frequency?**  
A: As needed — sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes weekly.
