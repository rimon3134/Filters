## ✨ Why RK’s Filter Lists?

The modern web is overloaded — ads, trackers, popups, overlays, telemetry, AI scripts, autoplay media, and anti-adblock mechanisms compete aggressively for control.

**RK’s Custom Filter Lists are designed to:**  

- 🔹 Eliminate noise without breaking sites  
- 🔹 Target same-domain annoyances most lists miss  
- 🔹 Preserve speed, layout, and usability  
- 🔹 Provide layered filtering — domain-level + hybrid/cosmetic + network  
- 🔹 Reduce unnecessary bulk: only **high-priority, impactful entries** included  

> _Not about blocking everything — only what actually matters._

## 🧰 System-Level Filtering

These lists are not just browser-focused. They can also be adapted for:  

- **DNS-level filtering** (network-wide protection, blocking telemetry and trackers)  
- **OS-level filtering** (host file integration for system-wide domain blocking)  
- **Router-level or network appliance filtering**  

_Your system deserves the same clarity, control, and protection as your browser._

**Q: Mobile compatibility?**  
A: Yes — Every List is mobile-optimized; hybrid lists work in uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and compatible apps.
