## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why not rely only on generic large lists?**  
A: Domain-only lists miss same-domain annoyances like popups, redirects, and overlays. Hybrid rules handle them.

**Q: Will sites break?**  
A: Minimal false positives — hybrid rules carefully tested. Aggressive elements removed **before rendering**.

**Q: Mobile compatibility?**  
A: Yes — ZeroDNS is mobile-optimized; hybrid lists work in uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and compatible apps.

**Q: Update frequency?**  
A: As needed — sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes weekly.
